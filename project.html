        <h2>Download Postman</h2>
        <p>The following project will be handled primarily with Postman. If you have not done so already, visit <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/">GetPostman.com.</a> and download a free copy of their software to get started.</p>
        <h2>Obtain Authentication</h2>
        <p>Before you can submit a request from the Workfront API, you'll need to obtain the proper authentication in order to get started. This example shows how to establish authentication by logging in and obtaining a session ID, which will be used to validate all of your requests.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Using Postman, send the following request in order to log in to your instance of Workfront:</p>
                <div class="codesamp">https://<i><b>YourDomain</b></i>.workfront.com/attask/api/login?username=<i><b>YourUserName</b></i>>&password=<i><b>YourPassword</b></i>>&meth=post</div>
                <p>Here is an example of a complete URI and where to enter it in Postman:</p>
                <img src="img\LOGINexample.png"/>
            </li>
            <li><p>If the information that you sent as a request is correct, you received a 200 status response in the response header summary like this:</p></li>
            <img src="img\LOGIN200response.png"/>
            <p>The full response contains information about your account, which API version you're accessing, and other information that is unique to your login:</p>
            <img src="img\LOGINresponse.png"/>
            <li><p>Locate the "sessionID" field in the response and copy the ID that follows the "sessionID" heading, excluding the quoatation marks that surround the actual ID</p></li>
            <img src="img\LOGINrespSESH.png"/>
            <li><p>This session ID is used to authenticate your requests. Include it at as the last parameter in all your requests, just before your method, seperating it from the other parameters using an ampersand.</p></li>

        </ol>
        <h2>Make a request</h2>
        <p>In the Workfront API, a request can complete all of the actions as defined by the RESTful CRUD acronym:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>C</b>reate</li>
                <li><b>R</b>ead</li>
                <li><b>U</b>pdate</li>
                <li><b>D</b>elete</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The corresponding RESTful HTTP operations to the aforementioned actions are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>POST: allows you create a new object</p></li>
            <li><p>GET: allows you to view an object</p></li>
            <li><p>PUT: allows you to update an already existing object with new information</p></li>
            <li><p>DELETE: allows you to delete an existing object</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Create a new project in your instance of Workfront by using the following URI and the POST method:</p>
        <div class="codesamp">https://<i><b>YourDomain</b></i>.workfront.com/attask/api/v11.0/project?name=<i><b>Name of New Project</b></i>&sessionID=<i><b>YourSessionID</b></i></div>
        <blockquote class="note">Notice that spaces are permitted in the project name parameter.</blockquote>
        <p>Here is an example of what that looks like in Postman:</p>
        <img src="img\REQexamp.png"/>
        <h2>Analyzing the Response</h2>
        <p>Here are some interesting points to observe about this endpoint.</p>
        <h2>Printing Values from the JSON Response</h2>
        <p>Making requests and viewing the endpoints are important steps in the processes of creating a program, but they don't necessarily have anything to do with the program itself. In order to create a program, the information that you are trying to obtain needs to be printed, stored, or updated somewhere. In this project, the information that you obtain from your request will be printed into a web document. This method is identical to the process that you would use if you were creating an API to send information to a hosted website. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In other applications, you might wish to print values to a CSV or TXT file that can be read in another program, like word or Google Sheets. Or, you might use another method, like PUT&#160;or POST to update your Workfront project with new information. </p>
        <h2>You've just created a simple Workfront API</h2>
        <p>Congratulations! You've just created your first Workfront API&#160;program. With the information that you've learned throughout this Getting Started section, you should be ready to start looking more closely at the Workfront API and Workfront API&#160;Documenation via the documents contained in section II: Workfront Documentation. </p>
        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>While this simple program might not seem like a big deal, it contains the basic concepts of API construction which you can utilize to start diving into more complex topics.</p>
