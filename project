        <h1>Building a Simple API&#160;Program</h1>
        <h2>Download Postman</h2>
        <p>The following project will be handled primarily with Postman. If you have not done so already, visit the Postman Site and download a free copy of their software to get started. </p>
        <h2>Obtain Authentication</h2>
        <p>Before you can submit a request from the Workfront API, you'll need to obtain the proper authentication in order to get started. In this case, you can...</p>
        <h2>Make a Request Using Postman</h2>
        <p>When working with unfamiliar endpoints in any API system, submitting a request to an endpoint allows you to look at a response so you can better decide how to parse the information being returned from that endpoint and method.</p>
        <h2>Analyzing the Response</h2>
        <p>Here are some interesting points to observe about this endpoint.</p>
        <h2>Printing Values from the JSON Response</h2>
        <p>Making requests and viewing the endpoints are important steps in the processes of creating a program, but they don't necessarily have anything to do with the program itself. In order to create a program, the information that you are trying to obtain needs to be printed, stored, or updated somewhere. In this project, the information that you obtain from your request will be printed into a web document. This method is identical to the process that you would use if you were creating an API to send information to a hosted website. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In other applications, you might wish to print values to a CSV or TXT file that can be read in another program, like word or Google Sheets. Or, you might use another method, like PUT&#160;or POST to update your Workfront project with new information. </p>
        <h2>You've just created a simple Workfront API</h2>
        <p>Congratulations! You've just created your first Workfront API&#160;program. With the information that you've learned throughout this Getting Started section, you should be ready to start looking more closely at the Workfront API and Workfront API&#160;Documenation via the documents contained in section II: Workfront Documentation. </p>
        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>While this simple program might not seem like a big deal, it contains the basic concepts of API construction which you can utilize to start diving into more complex topics.</p>
