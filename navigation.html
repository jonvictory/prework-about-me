<h1>Getting Started with the Workfront API</h1>
	<p>The following documents are designed to familiarize you with REST API Architecture and how that structure relates to the Workfront API. This is by no means meant to be a comprehensive introduction to REST Architecture or the Workfront API, but is instead intended to give you just enough background on both topics so that you can create your first Workfront API.</p>

<li><h2><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/buildapi">Build your own integrations with the Workfront API</a></h2></li>
	<p>APIs offer a solution to the high-speed nature of SAS driven technologies that might not function exactly how you want (or need them to) right out of the box. Through integration, you can use the Workfront API to achieve the functionality that you desire from Workfront products.</p>
<li><h2><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/restful.html">REST Architecture and the Workfront API</a></h2></li>
	<p>The Workfront API is structured under the standards of REST Architecture in order to make it easy to learn, simple to work with, and efficiently scalable.</p>
<li><h2><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/postman.html">Why use Postman?</a></h2></li>
	<p>Using a GUI client to test your requests and analyze responses can drastically simplify the process of building an API, regardless of what your end goals are.</p>
<li><h2><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/authentication">Authentication</a></h2></li>
	<p>In order to make requests and receive responses from the Workfront API, you must have the correct authentication for every call that you wish to make.</p>
<li><h2><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/send.html">Sending requests</a></h2></li>
	<p>In order to retrieve information from API servers you must first make a request. Different requests will return different responses based on a number of different categorical variables.</p>
<li><h2><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/response.html">Analyzing responses</a></h2></li>
	<p>You API will use the information returned in a response as the basis for how it functions. It is important to know what is being returned in a reponse so that you can properly extract and utilize the information that you receive.</p>

	<p>This guide will walk you through the process of building a simple API using the Workfront API</p>
