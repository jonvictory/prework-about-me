<h1>Getting Started with the Workfront API</h1>
	<p>The "Getting Started" documentation is designed to familiarize you with Application Program Interfaces (APIs) while introducing you to the basic concepts of the Workfront API and its documentation. These documents contain the minimum amount of information that is necessary for you to create a simple Workfront API.</p>
	<p>Familiarity with these basic concepts enables you to explore the deeper structures of the Workfront API and documentation. To reinforce your learning, there is a simple project included at the end of the section to walk you through the processes involved with creating a simple API, step-by-step, from start to finish.</p>

<h2><li><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/buildapi">Integrations with the Workfront API</a></li></h2>
	<p>APIs offer a solution to the high-speed nature of SAS driven technologies that might not function exactly how you want (or need them to) right out of the box. Through integration, you can use the Workfront API to achieve the functionality that you desire from Workfront products.</p>
<h2><li><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/restful.html">REST architecture</a></li></h2>
	<p>The Workfront API is structured under the standards of REST Architecture in order to make it easy to learn, simple to work with, and efficiently scalable.</p>
<h2><li><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/postman.html">Graphic User Interface (GUI) REST client</a></li></h2>
	<p>Using a GUI client to test your requests and analyze responses can drastically simplify the process of building an API, regardless of what your end goals are.</p>
<h2><li><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/authentication">Authentication</a></li></h2>
	<p>In order to make requests and receive responses from the Workfront API, you must have the correct authentication for every call that you wish to make.</p>
<h2><li><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/send.html">Requests</a></li></h2>
	<p>In order to retrieve information from API servers you must first make a request. Different requests will return different responses based on a number of different categorical variables.</p>
<h2><li><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/response.html">Responses</a></li></h2>
	<p>You API will use the information returned in a response as the basis for how it functions. It is important to know what is being returned in a reponse so that you can properly extract and utilize the information that you receive.</p>
<h2><li><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/project.html">Project: Create a Workfront API</a></li></h2>
	<p>This guide will walk you through the process of building a simple API using the Workfront API</p>
