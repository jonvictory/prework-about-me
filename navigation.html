<h1>Getting Started with the Workfront API</h1>
	<p>If you're not a professinal developer and you're looking for more information about the Workfront API, this is the best place to start. The "Getting Started" documentation is designed to familiarize you with Application Program Interfaces (APIs) while introducing you to the basic concepts of the Workfront API and its documentation.</p>
	<p>Familiarity with these basic concepts enables you to explore the deeper structures of the Workfront API and documentation. To reinforce your learning, there is a simple project included at the end of the section to walk you through the processes involved with creating a simple API, step-by-step, from start to finish.</p>

<h2><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/buildapi">Introduction to the Workfront API</a></h2>
	<p>Application Program Interfaces (APIs) facilitate communication between different programs and servers. Through the workfront API you can access, sort, and format information in ways that might not be readily accessible through a normal instance of Workfont.</p>
<h2><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/restful.html">REST architecture</a></h2>
	<p>The Workfront API is structured under the standards of REST Architecture in order to make it easy to learn, simple to work with, and scalable.</p>
<h2><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/postman.html">Graphic User Interface (GUI) REST client</a></h2>
	<p>An API user interface (UI) is a tool that allows you to make requests to API servers and analyze their responses. A Graphic User Interface (GUI) REST client can simplify these processes by offering you a visual way to sort your requests and responses. The examples covered in the Getting Started documentation will be presented in a GUI REST client called Postman.</p>
<h2><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/authentication">Authentication</a></h2>
	<p>In order to make requests and receive responses from the Workfront API, you must always have the proper credentials. There are several different methods to obtain credentials and authenticate with them with the API servers. </p>
<h2><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/send.html">Requests</a></h2>
	<p>APIs work through a system of receiving requests and returning responses. Requests can be used to create new objects, read information about existing objects, make updates to an object, or delete an object. The structure of your request and the corresponding method you use will determine what infromation is returned to you in a response from the servers.</p>
<h2><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/response.html">Responses</a></h2>
	<p>The information returned through a response is the backbone for your reports or programs. It is important to know what information is being returned in a reponse and how the information is organized, so that your program can effectively utilize that data.</p>
<h2><a href="https://jonvictory.github.io/prework-about-me/project.html">Project: Create a Workfront API</a></h2>
	<p>This guide will walk you through the process of building a simple program using the Workfront API</p>
