        <a name="Why"></a><h2>Why use a GUI REST&#160;client?</h2>
        <p>GUI REST clients give you a visually-based organizational system for making requests to API databases and analyzing responses. Typically, they also include many other convenient features, like the ability to save requests and responses that you have made to different API databases.</p>
	    <p>GUI clients also allow you to quickly request endpoints using various methods without having to know any specific code or syntax, which is necessary when using command-line based clients like cURL.</p>
 
        <a name="Why2"></a><h2>Why use Postman?</h2>
        <p>Postman is a GUI REST client that is free to download and is available for both PC and Mac. All of the examples covered in the getting started section will be demonstrated in Postman. You can download your free copy directly from the publisher via their website <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/">GetPostman.com.</a></p>
